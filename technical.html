		<h3>2011 // HTML, CSS, SEO</h3>
		<p>I've been tinkering on the web since 2011, when I started a food blog in Wordpress. I actually invented the word "nom", if you can believe it. If you CAN'T believe it, you'd be on the right track because that last statement is not actually true. Just testing your BS meter; no reason this can't be fun :)</p>
		<p>That food blog (which you can still find <a href="http://capitalcityeatz.com/" target="blank">here</a>) was my first introduction to the architecture of the web. I learned all about Search Engine Optimization and bow Google indexed the internet. I learned how to use keyword planning tools to target keywords and weave into content for better Search Engine Ranking, and how to tinker with a blog page layout with HTML. I also got to eat a lot of great meals for free!</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2013-2015 // HTML, CSS, SQL</h3>
		<p>I began learning SQL in 2013 as a Media Coordinator for a Franchise chain based out of Charlotte, NC. Data was interesting to me, and Data was starting to trend BIG TIME. I was that guy walking around the office dropping "Big Data" buzzwords in all our marketing conversations. Big Data this, Big Data that. I became the Data guy on the marketing department and was able to save our analyst team a ton of time, just by learning to pull simple reports for the Marketing Managers.</p>
		<p>During my first 6 months, I was responsible for renewing print media ads based on past performance. I would query the point of sale database to collect the center's estimates and sales from the past year, and compare the phone numbers related with the estimates and sales to the print ad's call tracking data.</p>
		<p>I also handled a great deal of inbound call and email questions about digital marketing and web presence. Leveraging my previous web experience and general tinkering skills, I became the go-to guy on the team for the random stream of web requests: "Is it possible to add a youtube video to my homepage?", "Can you add a picture of my team to the website?",  "Can you update some copy for me?".</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2015 // RUBY ON RAILS, JQUERY, JAVASCRIPT, APIs, HTML, CSS, SQL, GITHUB</h3>
		<p>Startup life! I decided to leave my Marketing gig and see what was up in the startup world. Although initially brought into BREWPUBLIK as a Marketer, I quickly realized that our most important problems were on the Product and Operations side of the house. I switched gears, taking over and scaling the Operation from 50 units/month to our peak at 150 units/week in December 2016. My previous SQL experience was helpful, as our early process involved manually updating each customer's delivery information (product included, successfully delivered?, etc.) directly in the database with SQL. We did things the hard way. We did EVERYTHING the hard way. That experience actually inspired <a href="https://medium.com/@deallen7/what-lazy-and-creative-have-in-common-afb614e6df12">this</a> post on how it's acutally <i>good</i> to be "lazy". It's your incentive to organize and optimize processes!</p>
		<p>Over the course of the next year, in partnership with our 1 man development team, I helped guide the production of a custom user-interface for our Operations team, making sure SQL wasn't a pre-req for a warehouse manager ;)</p>
		<p>In August 2015, I enrolled in a 10-week Full-Stack Development Bootcamp with <a href="https://www.techtalentsouth.com/">Tech Talent South</a>. Read about what I learned <a href="https://medium.com/@deallen7/what-i-learned-in-a-10-week-ruby-on-rails-crash-course-a4da7aeb4932">here</a>! I learned how to write in Ruby, create and deploy Ruby on Rails applications to Heroku, integrate the Google Maps API into an app, manipulate HTML elements with JQuery and JavaScript, and how to use Github.</p>
		<p>After this course, I put my skills to work building a command-line text-message tool with the Twilio API. I used this tool to communicate via SMS with customers, before upgrading to a more comprehensive on-demand delivery fleet management tool.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2016 // RUBY, HTML, CSS, STRIPE API</h3>
		<p>As the manager for the Customer Support team, I was responsible for sifting through service tickets to parse out technical and design mistakes on our end, and user errors on the customer end. Both our Shopify payments system and our website payments system were supported by Stripe, and effective troubleshooting required that I gain an understanding of how the Stripe API was communicating with our websites and marketing automations.</p>
		<p>Merry Christmas! I wrote my girfriend a date scheduling script in Ruby, stored the file in a usb-drive and put it under the Christmas tree. She's a bit of a tech-nerd, too, and LOVED it. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>2017 // RUBY, WEBHOOKS, JQUERY, HTML, CSS, A-Frame</h3>
		<p>"What's a webhook?"... Conversation with our 1 man development team at BREWPUBLIK.</p>
		<p>Webhooks were the solution to my latest problem. It was taking too long for our warehouse managers to mark deliveries as "packed", "checked", and "delivered". I discovered that we could access data from our logistics tool, a tool that allowed drivers to mark deliveries as "complete", and pass that data to our warehouse user-interface, marking the deliveries as "complete" automatically. Technology for the win!</p>
		<p>"Use it or loose it!"... Inner dialgoue with myself.</p>
		<p>Understanding this rule of education, I endeaver to keep my Ruby, Command Line and Github skills alive with a few simple projects: a rock-paper-scissors script, a counter, and a couple of recipe scripts for biscuits and cookies! Yum. Check them out on my <a href="https://github.com/deallen7">github</a>, yo.</p>
		<p>You know what's cool these days? VR. I decided to dip a toe into A-Frame to check things out and wrote a couple of blogs about it <a href="https://medium.com/@deallen7/getting-started-with-a-frame-4-steps-to-building-webvr-experiences-with-html-b67684e983d">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@deallen7/world-building-adding-background-to-your-vr-world-and-giving-texture-to-your-shapes-4bff0b2b8414">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Remember that Ruby Date Scheduling tool from last Christmas? I'm a man of habit. I created a web-based date scheduling program using HTML, CSS and jQuery. Your starting to think I'm cheap, aren't you? Nonsense! There was plenty more underneath the Christmas Tree.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2018 // RUBY ON RAILS, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS</h3>
		<p>January 2018, I go all-in on development. Name of the game? Tutorials. Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials.</p>
		<p>This section is still under development!</p>

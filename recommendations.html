		<div class="row rec">"As one of our original team members, David was an integral part of our company's early and current success. He is truly a jack-of-all-trades - marketing, sales, tech, design, leadership. Skilled in all. He was able to contribute in any way needed, and his work was always quality. David's strengths as a leader and mentor still come up in conversation at our company today, as do his exceptional problem-solving skills. He made an impact on everyone he ever managed and worked on."</div>

		<div class="row rec">"For the majority of 2017, I had the pleasure of working under David Allen at BREWPUBLIK in Charlotte, North Carolina.  David was directly responsible for my hiring and was my supervisor during his time here.  
		<br>
		<br>
		David is excellent communicator and instructor. I started out in logistics and fulfillment, and David introduced me to many of the business and logistical processes at BREWPUBLIK. He inspired me and my fellow coworkers through his leadership and support.  Whenever we struggled, he was there to help and lend a hand.  
		<br>
		<br>
		From a business perspective, he had a strong passion for clarity and consistency of product. He encouraged discussion amongst our team to help us further the goals of the business. His leadership approach was beneficial to making sure everyone shared a similar vision for the goals and tasks ahead.  He fostered a productive work environment and motivated us to push harder, increase productivity and persevere though adversity.  He also encouraged all employees to strive to provide the best possible customer service experience. As a result, he drove growth and sales across all markets he was involved in.

		<div class="row rec">"David had a few people that worked under him that he helped grow and develop. The thing was that we were all totally different people that needed to be approached differently. David was able to use his people skills to change and adapt his approached based on the other person needs. Overall I would not be as successful I am today with the guidance and support from David."</div>
